# Algebra of Uncertainty

A lecture about Uncertainty and derivation of its Algebra

### Abstract

In this lecture we present a variation of the Dutch Book argument, as a method of quantifying uncertainty by way of _coherence_. We prove the equivalence between the principles of _coherence_ and _Kolmogorov axioms_ of probability. This gives rise to the Algebra of Uncertainty.
